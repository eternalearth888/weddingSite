      <p>Nikki and Joe met during fall semester of our sophomore year of college at the University of Wyoming. She is from Lafayette, CO and Joe is from Superior, CO (very close together), but they never were able to meet until college. They met through Cowboy Country Swing Club, which is a student organization on campus. Both of them love swing dancing and would attend every week. Eventually, the two of them started to talk consistently each week. The fact that they grew up in the same place gave them an instant connection, and they quickly became friends. The following semester, they started spending more time together after returning from winter break. After taking some time to seek the Lord in what the relationship should look like, on February 18, 2014 Joe told Nikki he wanted to enter into a relationship and she agreed! Fourteen months later, at the same swing dance club where the couple met, Joe proposed!  Currently they still enjoy swing dancing on a weekly basis, but they also like to go to sporting events together, playing video games, attempting to play Frisbee golf, and watching Netflix. They are so grateful for all of you in influencing their lives to where they are today, and are excited for you to share in this celebration with them.</p>
